## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I properly learnt how to use flexbox to layout the components in a website. Also got to know that you can individually control the border radius of each corners.

```css
.flexbox{
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}  
```
```css
.borderradius{
  border-bottom-left-radius: 50px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 50px;
}
```

### Continued development

Can use Javascript to dynamically change the value that are found in the design

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me to properly understand CSS FLexbox. This drastically improved my layouts
